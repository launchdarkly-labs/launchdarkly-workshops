# Lab 1

# Getting Started with the Toggle Outfitters App

Toggle Outfitters is a retailer whose online presence is in need of an update. We're going to help modernize their website, and we're going to minimize downtime while we're at it.

The first thing we want to do is release our minimally viable product. Currently, we have a "Coming Soon" page, but we want to at least list our products availability.

# Create a Flag

Let's begin by creating a feature flag. This flag won't do much right now, but over the next few challenges, we'll incorporate this and other flags into an application and watch LaunchDarkly in action.

1. From the left-hand navigation menu, click **Flags**
2. Click the **Create flag** button in the upper right-hand corner
3. For **Name**, enter:
```js
Release Updated Storefront
```
4. Under **Variations**:
   1. First **Name**:
```js
Store Enabled
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Second **Name**:
```js
Store Disabled
```
5. Click **Create flag** in the lower right-hand side of the screen.

Congratulations! You've created your first flag and you're ready to proceed to the next challenge!
