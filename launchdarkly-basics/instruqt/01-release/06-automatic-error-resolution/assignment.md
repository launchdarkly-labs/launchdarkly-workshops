# Lab 6

# Instant Error Resolution

Now that we completed our migration, our work is not over yet. Sometimes, errors can crop up quite some time after a release, and those errors can occur at the most inconvenient of times. With flag triggers, you can help protect your nights and weekends by automatically rolling back to a previous known good state.

# Update Our Code

First, we need to update our application to take action when something goes wrong. In a production environment, this is normally handled by your monitoring/incident tools. But for simplicity in this lab, we'll have our code handle this for us.

1. Open the [Code Editor](#tab-2), and locate the `/src/hooks/useErrorHandling.ts` file.
2. Replace ALL contents with the following:

```js
// hooks/useErrorHandling.ts
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useShoppingCart } from 'use-shopping-cart';

const useErrorHandling = () => {
  const triggerUrl = 'PASTE_URL_TRIGGER_HERE';
  const [errorState, setErrorState] = useState(false);

  const { clearCart } = useShoppingCart();

  const Trigger = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        triggerUrl,
        {
          method: "POST",
          body: JSON.stringify({
            eventName: "There was an error with the API",
          }),
        }
      );
      return response.status;
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("the fetch did not work");
    }
  };

  const errorTesting = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch("/api/checkout", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      if (jsonData == "the API is unreachable") {
        setErrorState(true);
         clearCart()
         Trigger()
        return 502;
      } else {
        setErrorState(false);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("is it running?");
      console.log(e)
    }
  };

  return { errorState, setErrorState, errorTesting };
};

export default useErrorHandling;
```
3. Save the file (^+S or ⌘+S, though it should autosave)

# Update Flag Settings

1. Switch over to the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.
1. Click **Flags** in the left navigation menu.
1. Click **Updated Billing IU**.
1. Move your mouse over the **Test** environment box in the upper-left under the flag name, click the three dots, then click **Configure flag environment**.
1. In the **Triggers** section, click **+ Add trigger**
1. Select the following values:
   1. **Trigger type**: Generic trigger
   1. **Trigger action**: Update flag targeting to *Off*
1. Click **Save Trigger**
1. Highlight the generated URL to copy it to the clipboard (NOTE: you must highlight and use ^+C or ⌘+C. The automatic copy does not work within the Instruqt platform).

# Connect the Code to the Trigger

1. Switch back over to the [Code Editor](#tab-2) tab.
1. Make sure `/src/hooks/useErrorHandling.ts` is still open.
1. On line 6, replace `PASTE_URL_TRIGGER_HERE` with the copied URL
1. Save the file (^+S or ⌘+S)

# Testing Our Trigger

With our trigger in place, let's reproduce the error we encountered in our fourth challenge.

1. Switch back over to the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.
1. Click **Flags** in the left navigation menu.
1. Click **Migrate to Stripe API**.
1. Click the On/Off toggle at the top left to turn the flag **Off**.
1. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**.
1. Finally, switch over to the [Toggle Outfitters](#tab-1) tab.
1. Login as **ron**, **leslie**, **april**, or **andy**.
1. Click *Add to Cart*

You'll see the error like we did in Challenge 4, except when you dismiss the error this time, you can see the error UI changes were reverted.

This is a great way to mitigate errors when we have unforeseen issues, but we still have the issue of one flag relying on another. In the next challenge, we'll see how to create dependencies with flags to avoid these types of errors to begin with.
