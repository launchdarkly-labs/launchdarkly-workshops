# Lab 5

# API Migration

In our previous challenge, we implemented a shopping cart for our frontend. However, we discovered an error when we tested it. As it turns out, we need to migrate our backend billing component to use the new billing system. Let's update our code so we can fix the error.

# Create the API Flag

1. From the left-hand navigation menu, click **Flags**
2. Click the **Create flag** button in the upper right-hand corner
3. For **Name**, enter:
```js
Migrate to Stripe API
```
4. Under **Configuration**, select **Release**
5. Under **Variations**:
   1. First **Name**:
```js
Stripe Checkout Enabled
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Second **Name**, enter:
```js
Stripe Checkout Disabled
```
6. Click **Create flag** in the lower right-hand side of the screen.

As we've seen in previous challenges, our new code will be disabled whether the flag is on or off. In order to allow our Developers to test the new feature, let's add targeting to our new flag.

1. Click **+ Add rule** and choose **Target segments**
1. From the **Segments** dropdown, select *Developers*
1. From the **Rollout** dropdown, select *Stripe Checkout Enabled*
1. Toggle the flag to **On** in the upper left
1. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**

# Update Our Code

To complete our migration and rollout our new API, we need to add the new functionality to our code.

1. Open the [Code Editor](#tab-2), and locate the `/src/pages/api/checkout.ts` file
2. Replace lines 50-55 with the following code:
```js
//in this code, we are first retrieving the value for the enableStripe flag,
// then, if it returns true, running a function that creates a checkout session in stripe.
//If you want to see how that works, take a look at the `/src/utils/checkout-helpers.ts` file.

  if (req.method === 'POST') {
  const migrateToStripeApi = await ldClient.variation("migrate-to-stripe-api", jsonObject, false);

    if (migrateToStripeApi) {
      createCheckoutForStripe(req, res)
    }
  } if (req.method === 'GET') {
    const migrateToStripeApi = await ldClient.variation("migrate-to-stripe-api", jsonObject, false);

    if (migrateToStripeApi) {
      try {
        res.send("You are good to go!");
      } catch (error: any) {
        console.error(error.message);
      }
    } else {
      return res.json("the API is unreachable");
    }
  }
```
3. Save the file (^+S or âŒ˜+S, though it should autosave)

# Pull It All Together

We previously turned off our **Updated Billing UI** flag due to errors, but if we refactored our code properly, it should work now. Let's go ahead and turn that back on since we've added the API component.

1. Switch back to the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab
1. From the left-hand navigation menu, click **Flags**
1. Click **Updated Billing UI**
1. Click the On/Off toggle at the top left to turn the flag **On**.
1. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**.

Switch to the [Toggle Outfitters](#tab-1) tab, login as **ron**, **leslie**, **april**, or **andy** and you will now be able to click *Add to Cart* successfully!

Nice work! It's great to be able to quickly turn off a flag to fix errors. But what if a developer isn't the first to catch it? In the next challenge, we'll take a look at automating risk mitigation.
