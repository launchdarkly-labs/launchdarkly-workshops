# Lab 4

# Adding a Shopping Cart

Instead of building our own shopping cart, let's use an existing framework. This will make it very easy to implement and maintain.

Let's start by creating a new flag to handle our new billing user interface:

1. From the left-hand navigation menu, click **Flags**
2. Click the **Create flag** button in the upper right-hand corner
3. For **Name**, enter:
```js
Updated Billing UI
```
4. Under **Configuration**, select **Release**
5. Under **Variations**:
   1. First **Name**:
```js
Enable Stripe
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Second **Name**:
```js
Self-hosted Form
```
6. Click **Create flag** in the lower right-hand side of the screen.

The settings we've created for this flag will prevent our new feature from being seen by everyone--whether the flag is on or off. But we do want our developers to begin testing the new feature, so let's add a targeting rule which just allows those in the Developers segment to use the new feature.

1. Click **+ Add rule** and choose **Target segments**
1. From the **Segments** dropdown, select *Developers*
1. From the **Rollout** dropdown, select *Enable Stripe*
1. Toggle the On/Off flag to **On** in the upper left
1. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**


# Next: Add the Code

Within our application, we need to implement the new feature that will be controlled via this **Updated Billing UI** feature flag.

1. Open the [Code Editor](#tab-2), and locate the `/src/components/inventory.tsx` file.
2. Scroll to **line 131** and locate the `<ReserveButton />` object. Replace the entire `<ReserveButton />` code block (lines 131-138) with the following:

```js
{
  updatedBillingUi ? (
    <AddToCartButton
      product={product}
      errorTesting={errorTesting}
      clickHandler={addToCartClickHandler}
    />
  ) : (
    <ReserveButton
      setHandleModal={setHandleModal}
      handleModal={handleModal}
      handleClickTest={handleClickTest}
      updateField={updateField}
      formData={{ name, email }}
      onButtonClick={onButtonClick}
    />
  )
}
{
  updatedBillingUi && (
    <ErrorDialog errorState={errorState} setErrorState={setErrorState} />
  )
}
```
3. Save the file (^+S or âŒ˜+S, though it should autosave)

Switch over the the [Toggle Outfitters](#tab-1) tab. Login as **ron**, **leslie**, **april**, or **andy**, and you will see the **Reserve Yours** button has changed to **Add to cart**.


# Finally: Run a Quick Test

Make sure you're still logged in as **ron**, **leslie**, **april**, or **andy**, then click the **Add to Cart** button on one of the items.

Whoops! It looks like there's an error in our system!

No matter how much testing we do, sometime buggy code can make it into our production environment. Fortunately, LaunchDarkly allows you to recovery in just seconds!

1. Go back to the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.
1. Toggle the On/Off flag to **Off** in the upper left
1. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**

Review the [Toggle Outfitters](#tab-1) site once more, and even though you're logged in as a developer, we can no longer see the new **Add to Cart** function since the entire feature is now off.

Great work! In the next challenge, we'll see how we can further automate recoveries and make migrations a cinch!
